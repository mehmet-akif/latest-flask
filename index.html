  <h1>Building a Simple Web Page with Flask and Hosting on GitHub Pages</h1>
  <p>
    For this project, I chose Flask as the web development framework due to its versatility and ease of use. Installing Flask was straightforward; I used Python's package manager, pip, by executing <code>pip install Flask</code> in the terminal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creating the web page involved setting up the basic structure within Flask. I designed the routes in a Python file named <code>app.py</code>, defining the homepage ("/") and using Flask's <code>render_template</code> function to dynamically display content from an <code>index.html</code> file located within a <code>templates</code> folder. Styling was achieved by incorporating CSS into the HTML file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hosting the web page on GitHub Pages was the next step. I created a new repository on GitHub and uploaded the Flask application files, including <code>app.py</code>, <code>index.html</code>, and associated CSS and assets. Accessing the repository settings on GitHub, I navigated to the "Pages" section and configured the source to the main branch. This enabled the repository to serve the web page, generating a link for external access.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the process, certain challenges were encountered and addressed. Initially, I experimented with multiple frameworks before settling on Flask for its simplicity and adaptability to the project's requirements. Additionally, setting up GitHub Pages posed some confusion initially, but by carefully following the documentation and configuring the repository settings correctly, the hosting issue was resolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    In conclusion, the utilization of Flask as the framework for developing this web page proved efficient and manageable. Integrating Flask's features with GitHub Pages enabled seamless hosting, overcoming initial setup challenges. This experience not only helped in creating a functional web page but also provided valuable insights into web development using Flask and deploying projects through GitHub Pages.
